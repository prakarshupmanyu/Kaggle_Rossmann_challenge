# Kaggle_Rossmann_challenge
This file contains my approach to solving the Rossmann Sales Stores challenge which can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

The approach is similar to solving any Data Science problem: 

1 - Understand the problem 

2 - Inspect the given data 

3 - Pre-process the data - clean it, modify it, enhance it 

4 - Work with different kinds of models to see which one is the best fit for the given problem 

5 - Train the model using the processed data 

6 - Test the validity of the data
